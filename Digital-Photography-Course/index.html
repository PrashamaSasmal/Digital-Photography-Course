    <h1>Digital Photography</h1>
    <div class="">
      <h3>What is digital photography?</h3>
      <p>Digital photography is the process of using electronic and computing appliances to capture, create, edit and
        share digital images/photographs. It encompasses several different technologies to provide electronic or
        computer-based photography services.</p>

      <p> It is mainly used as a means to create, publish or use digital photographs on computers and/or the Internet.
      </p>

      <p>Typically, a digital photograph - the outcome of digital photography - is stored in a bitmap (BMP) format.
        However, it can vary from device/technology and per user requirements. It replaces standard photography's
        conventional microfilm with storage cards or computer storage devices to store/access a captured/scanned/copied
        image.</p>
      <ul type="circle">
        <li><span>Electronic/digital cameras:</span>These capture images/photographs and store them in
          built-in/integrated storage media cards.</li>
        <li><span>Computing devices:</span> Examples include a webcam integrated with a computer/laptop or a scanner
          that enables the capturing of existing physical (paper/card) images.</li>
        <li><span>Digital photography software:</span> Purpose-built software enables the modification of texture,
          color, brightness and many other image attributes.</li>

      <h3>How to use digital cameras in phoography? </h3>
      <p> If you want to become a famous photographer and bask in the glory, the first aspect of photography you need to
        master is using a digital single-lens reflex camera. Let us presume you have already glanced into your new
        camera’s manual and learned what all those numerous buttons and levers do so that you are able to operate your
        device with ease: then you must be craving to take your first photo. To make it a masterpiece, let us follow
        several simple instructions.</p>

      <table>
        <tr>
          <td><img class="ph-img" src="images/lenscap.jpg" alt="Lens Cap"></td>
          <td>
            <h5>1.Lens Cap</h5>
            <p>Though it may sound unnecessary for the first step, do not forget to take the protective cap off the
              lens. A solid part of photography is about capturing the right moment, and it is disappointing to miss one
              just because of your own carelessness.</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><img class="ph-img" src="images/frame.jpg" alt="Frame"></td>
          <td>
            <h5>2.Framing</h5>
            <p>Find a solid frame. It is a matter of practice. For starters, try not to crop peoples’ heads or other
              body parts, and do not put objects right in the frame’s center. Leave some head space or your images will
              appear overloaded.</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><img class="ph-img" src="images/modes.jpg" alt="different modes"></td>
          <td>
            <h5>3.Different Mode</h5>
            <p>Adjust aperture, shutter speed, and ISO values. Or to make a process faster and easier, use A- or S-modes
              (‘aperture priority’ and ‘shutter priority’ modes respectively). The A-mode allows you to set the F-number
              (which influences the depth of field), while automatics take care of ISO and shutter speed. S-mode does
              the same for shutter speed, which affects whether the objects in your picture will be blurry or clear</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><img class="ph-img" src="images/focus.jpg" alt="focus"></td>
          <td>
            <h5>4.Autofocus</h5>
            <p>Let your camera autofocus by pushing the release button halfway, and then slightly press it to the end to
              make a shot. If you shoot at nightfall, set shutter speed low and use a tripod to exclude image
              distortions caused by your hands’ shaking. If your camera cannot focus on its own (which often happens
              when it is dark outdoors) switch from auto to manual mode, and focus your lens on lights, or to the
              infinity.</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td><img class="ph-img" src="images/adjust.jpg" alt="adjustments"></td>
          <td>
            <h5>5.Adjustments</h5>
            <p>Do not be afraid to post-process your photos. Digital photography grants you a wide variety of ways to
              improve your images’ quality, so feel free to use them—at least until you become a professional. At the
              same time, many professionals use Photoshop as well. Anyway, you may be surprised how simple saturation,
              contrast, or hue adjustments are able to make your images look much better.</p>
          </td>
        </tr>
      </table>
      <h3>Are you Ready?</h3>
      <p>Take multiple shots. Hardened pros may follow the rule ‘One shot—one hit,’ but to do that you must take
        thousands of photos before. Taking several shots of one frame will give you an opportunity to choose the best
        among similar images. So, shoot, shoot, and shoot.

      <h3>
        How can you edit photo to make it more attractive?
      </h3>
      <p>1.Download a photo-editing application. There are plenty of free editing applications available in the Google
        Play Store on Android or App Store on iPhone and iPad. If you want to explore different styles, then download a
        few apps and play around with their effects. Examples include the following:
      <ul>
        <li> Snapseed (Free)</li>
        <li>PicsArt (Free)</li>
        <li>VSCO (Free)</li>
        <li>Instagram (Free)</li>
        <li>Adobe Photoshop Express (Free)</li>
      </ul>
      </p>
      <p>2.Open a photo editing app. After you download and install a photo editing app from the App Store or Google
        Play Store, tap the app on your home screen or apps menu to open the app.</p>
      <p>3.Take a picture or select a photo. Most apps give you the option to either take a new picture (look for the
        button with the camera on it) or choose one from your photo library (Look for a plus "+" icon). You should see
        the photo in the center of the screen with options and icons at the top and/or bottom of the screen.</p>
      <p>4.Choose a filter. Every app is different, but many of them, like Instagram, have a variety of "filters" or
        "lenses" to choose from, which essentially do all of the editing for you. Look for tabs or icons at the bottom
        or top of the photo preview to see what adjustments you can make with the app you are using. Most photo editing
        apps display filters as tiny thumbnail previews at the bottom of the screen. Tap a thumbnail image to see a
        preview of how it will affect your image. Look for slider bars or an icon with slider bars that you can use to
        adjust the intensity of the filter.</p>
      <p>5.Adjust the exposure. In photography, exposure refers to the amount of light that falls on a photo. If the
        photo is too dark, then you might need to increase the exposure. If you want the photo darker, then lower the
        exposure.</p>
      <p>6.
        Adjust the saturation. Some apps allow you to adjust the saturation, or intensity of color, in a photo.
        Increasing the saturation of a photo can make the colors pop and make the photo more eye-catching. Too much
        saturation, though, can make the photo look harsh and almost cartoon-like.</p>
      <p>7.Crop the photo. Cropping a photo is a good way to add more focus on the subject in the image by cutting out
        some of the background in the image. The crop tool usually has an icon that resembles two right angles forming a
        square. To crop an image select the crop tool and then drag the corners of the image inward so that the light
        part of the image is centered around the subject in the image.</p>
      <p>8.Every app is different, so if it is your first time using one, you might want to go through and check out all
        the different options for how to edit the photo.</p>
